The LHCb collaboration, together with the other three main Large Hadron Collider collaborations, ATLAS, CMS and ALICE, has been awarded the 2025 [Breakthrough Prize](https://breakthroughprize.org/) in Fundamental Physics:

> For detailed measurements of Higgs boson properties confirming the symmetry-breaking mechanism of mass generation, the discovery of new strongly interacting particles, the study of rare processes and matter-antimatter asymmetry, and the exploration of nature at the shortest distances and most extreme conditions at CERNâ€™s Large Hadron Collider.

The prize has been awarded to all current and former members of the four collaborations who have authored Run 2 data papers by 15 July 2024.

As stated in the [official page](https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/1/P1/Y2025), the $3 million prize is allocated to ATLAS ($1 million), CMS ($1 million), ALICE ($500,000) and LHCb ($500,000). The prize money will be used by the collaborations to offer grants for doctoral students from member institutes to spend research time at CERN, giving the students experience working at the forefront of science and new expertise to bring back to their home countries and regions. The name of each winner can be found on the experiment pages below.

The full list of the LHCb laureates, can be found in the [LHCb subpage](https://breakthroughprize.org/Laureates/1/L3995).
